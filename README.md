A project to demonstrate different types of artifical intelligence algorithms which can play chess. All AIs are algorithmic and do not use machine learning but still demonsrate how a basic algorithm can play chess at a better than beginner level. The project uses a basic Flask web server to host the interface for playing against an AI or watching two AIs play against eachother. The web interface is basic HTML and JavaScript and makes use of the chessboard.js library for displaying the chess board and Socket.IO for real time interaction between the server and client to make the game play in real time.
